# oca8_puzzles
These sample programs were originally intended for OCA8. As OCA11 came along, thought of using this space for some of the OCA11 topics as well.
Files related to OCA11 will have comment on the top of each source file. 
Ideally, you should be able to tell, which program belongs to which exam type - OCA8 or OCA11. :)
Note: This repo may be active for some time in 2019 and then may go inactive for ever. It means I have completed OCA/OCP11 :)
